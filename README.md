## What is this?

If you ever played Skyblock, this gamemode is very similar but instead you get all of your resources from a single block that regenerates after you break it.

## Features?

- Fully customisable
- Players can have their own "Blocks"/islands
- A group of mobs has a chance of spawning after each time you break the block
